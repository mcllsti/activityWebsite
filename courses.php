<h1>Courses</h1>

<p>

At Murr Activity Center we offer a range of courses that suite individuals of all ages
and skill levels. All courses have been priced to keep them affordable so no one will
miss out on the fantastic activity's on offer.</br></br> Since out courses are constantly
changing we keep this list updated weekly and only take bookings for that week.
Each course takes place every day of that week.</br> </br> </br> </br>

All the course prices include the time spent with an instructor, as well as the
cost for the hire of the equipment for the duration of the course.
